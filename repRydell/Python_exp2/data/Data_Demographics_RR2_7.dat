7	19	Journalism	Male	To determine whether or not the first test of associating positive words with Bob would affect our opinions or judgements of Bob after the second test with the negative actions.	I believe it was easier for me to match when it was positive words and Bob both on the same button because my first impression of Bob was a positive one and so it is easier for my brain to associate good words with Bob than bad words because my brain still subconsciously is carrying those positive feelings of Bob.
