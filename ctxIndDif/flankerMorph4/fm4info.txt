This is the fourth version of the flanker experiment, used in Hope’s master’s thesis —letter morphs surrounded by one of the following: a grid of As or Hs or a grid where the center row could create either “CAT” or “THE”.  The morphed letters were twice as likely to appear than the pure letters.  Participants were asked to judge whether the target letter was more “H”-like or more “A”-like.
