Column Labels (from JET)

1. Participant Number
2. Trial Number
3. Block Number
4. Trial Within Block
5. Difference in size between screwheads (1 <- none, 2 <- small, 3 <- large)
6. Difference in angle between screwheads (1 <- none, 2 <- small, 3 <- large)
7. Change Type (in two text characters: N <- no difference, L <- small difference, H <- large difference; described as XY where X is the change type for the size [column 5] and Y is the change type for the angle [column 6])
8. Did both features differ (1 <- Yes, 0 <- No)
9. Radius (in pixels) of screwhead on the left
10. Angle (clockwise from vertical) of screwhead on the left
11. Radius (in pixels) of screwhead on the right
12. Angle (clockwise from vertical) of screwhead on the right
13. Participant response (1 <- Both features different, 0 <- At least one feature the same)
14. Accuracy (1 <- Correct response, 0 <- Incorrect response)
15. Reaction Time
16. Bad Trial Indicator (1 <- Participant responded too quickly [i.e. less than 150 ms], 0 <- Participant did no respond too quickly)
17. Bad Trial Counter (total number of bad trials so far)
18 - 23. Timestamps for trial start, fixation onset, stimulus onset, blank onset, probe onset, and participant response, respectively (because this was a purely perceptual task, fixation onset, stimulus onset, and blank onset are identical; these three variables are included because the task was originally devised to run both perceptual and memory versions of the task)
24. Task Type (0 <- Perceptual, 1 <- Memory; All should be 0)
25. Feedback Type (C <- Correct Answer feedback, E <- Incorrect Answer feedback, N <- No Feedback [because trial was bad; see column 16])
