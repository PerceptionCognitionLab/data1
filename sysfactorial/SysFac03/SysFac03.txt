Originally intended to be a version of the sysfactorial line of experiments
that used the nested square stimuli as seen in Luck & Vogel (1997).  Scrapped
after realizing that the nested square stimuli would most likely not meet the
assumption of selective influence that is needed for SFT methods to work.
